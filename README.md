This is the shopping cart project from The Odin Project's React course.

This project focuses on: 
- using contexts, 
- creating custom hooks, 
- and routers.

Future improvements can include:
- style home page,
- testing for user events,
- testing for routing,
- individual pages for each product,
- and additional styling.
